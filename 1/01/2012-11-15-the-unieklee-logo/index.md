Whenever one rebrands something, that usually entails a complete new look. I have recently gone through a rebranding of myself. I have moved from [leew4jc](http://leew4jc.com) to [UniekLee](http://twitter.com/UniekLee).<!--more--> You can ready about why I chose to do this in my blog post, [Why UniekLee?](http://unieklee.com/old/why-unieklee/) One of the things that comes with a rebranding is a new logo. I know what you're thinking - you're a human being, why do you need a logo? Well, I don't. I have no use for one at all. But I want one: it's cool, it's fun, it's something that I enjoy.<!-- more -->

Now when it comes to designing a logo, I have very strong beliefs about what a logo should be. A logo should represent it's subject in every aspect. I believe it should be simple enough for someone to doodle when they have nothing else to do, but yet recognisable that it isn't confused with anything else.

In order to come up with a logo for myself I had a look at the things that I like. I like corny humor; clever design; clean, simple lines; precision; style and class; a modern feel and probably a whole bunch of other stuff. I even went through an exercise with a friend naming brands that I like, choosing between two given examples, and identifying with celebrities. This didn't really help me in any way, but it helped my friend describe what I wanted to a designer.


## My UniekLee Idea


I also like a logo that integrates a name and a picture into a single image. If this is done correctly it can result in something amazing. This is what I wanted. My idea was to use the word Uniek to form a stick man. I came up with the idea one night and sketched it out very quickly.

I thought that this was a great idea, and I still do. I love the idea. The problem is converting that wiry, wobbly, vague concept into something bold and exciting. Something breathtaking. I wanted the word "Uniek" to be a stick man, and the word "Lee" to be at has feet, labeling this particular stick man. But unfortunately, the idea didn't come together on computer. I know that this is down to two things. The designer not understanding where I wanted the idea to go, and, more importantly, me not knowing where I wanted the idea to go, or how to get it there. The end result - no stick man logo.


## The Resultant UniekLee


The result, however, is actually something I quite like. There is no image involved, but the letters ok the word "Uniek" all mould into each other. I think this is really inventive and results in something that's sort of modern, clean and rather clever. Overall, I like it very much. The way "Uniek" moulds together also means that "Lee" stands out as the predominant word, which works out pretty well in this case. Here is the final product:

Overall I am happy with the end result. It's not my stick man idea, but, as [my friend Kelly](http://twitter.com/moonglotexas) says, not all good concepts work out. But then again, this concept was actually pretty good too, it just wasn't mine.

So, what do you think? Does this represent UniekLee well? Does it stand out, intrigue you, make you want to look again? Is the word "Uniek" obvious enough? Or is it just boring and forgettable?
