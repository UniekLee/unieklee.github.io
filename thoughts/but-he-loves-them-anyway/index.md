# But He loves them anyway


On Friday night (Good Friday, 18/04/2014) we held a stay awake for the youth of Highway Church; Double Impact. One of our late-night activities was to hold a Tenebrae service.<!--more-->

The service moved through the different things that Jesus had to endure on His way to the cross. Not the physical things, but the emotional things. Something struck me as we went through this.

It was the love that He showed in times that most would be incredibly hurt. When people betrayed His trust, or denied Him. Those moments that He must have felt completely unloved, unwanted, uncared for. Jesus must have felt like that - He was human. But He loves them anyway. And I write that in the present continuous tense for a purpose! He loves. It's not that He loved, but rather, that He loves.

I've writted this in the form of a poem, but it's not about the poetry. The poetry is actually poor. It's about the emotion that Jesus must have felt. It's about what He endured. It's about the fact that He loves us anyway. And that is mind blowing.


## But He loves them anyway


Friends would offer Him up to be betrayed
But He loves them anyway

Others would give up when He asked them to pray
But He loves them anyway

Yet others would denied they knew Him in any way
But He loves them anyway

Some would accuse Him in every way
But He loves them anyway

He would be so badly beaten on that day
But He loves them anyway

Kill Him! Kill Him! Kill Him! all would say
But He loves them anyway

He would be nailed to a tree to stay
But He loves them anyway

Not long after His life would slip away
But He loves them anyway

He would rise again on the third day
But He loves them anyway

Some wouldn't recognise Him, nay
But He loves them anyway

But, it's unfair for us "them" to say
Because **we** are guilty, **we** betray
**We** also neglect to pray

And when we deny Him our agape
He loves **us** anyway
