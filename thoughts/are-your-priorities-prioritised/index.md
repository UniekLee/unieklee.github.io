# Are your priorities prioritised?


If you had to ask God what makes one person a better Christian than another, what do you think He would say?<!--more--> I'm not sure He would say that one is better than another, but the point is, what do you think is most important to God?


## Possible priorities


Would it be the amount of time you spend with Him daily? How well you know the bible? How much of your income you give? How much time you devote to mission or justice? How well they can answer questions about God? The outworking of the gifts of the Holy Spirit in your life? How much emotion you feel towards God? How many ways You serve God? How many people know Him because of you? How well you obey the laws? How holy or different are you from "normal" people?


## The problem with priorities


See, I ask these questions because we all have different priorities - things that we consider important. I know that I sometimes consider myself better than another because I think this or think that, or because I do/don't do this or that.

**For example** - I would consider myself a better Christian than someone who professes to be a Christian, but who drinks excessively, or smokes, or lies.

But the truth is, me thinking that I'm better than someone else because of those things is probably a bigger issue than whether those things are right or wrong, better or worse. Who's to say that those things are of utmost importance to God?


## Points to challenge this piety


I guess I'm trying to get at three things:



	  1. **Do you compare yourself to others and consider yourself better or worse than them?**
I do, and I need help to deal with those pride issues.
	  2. **Whose standards or priorities do you use to make that assessment?**
I use the things that _I_ am comfortable conforming to...not necessarily what God says matters.
	  3. **Are the things that are important to you, the things that are important to God?**
I'd like to think so...but I'm pretty sure that the order I prioritise them in is different to Him.

I'm a mess, I know. And that's ok. At least if I know that I'm a mess, I can work on it!

One person is no better or worse than any other. Even just _one_ sin/issue/mistake is worthy of death. I am only alive by the grace of God. Let me not try exalt myself above others, but rather humble myself before God, try to please Him (not others or myself,) and encourage others to do the same.

There's so much more I could say about this, but I think I'll just leave it there otherwise I'll be talking for ages.
