      <description>This week Yolandi and I have been getting up early to exercise - we&amp;rsquo;re on the Joe Wicks 90 day plan. Or at least, she is. And I&amp;rsquo;m just following along.
Monday - Wednesday this week we got up at 06:30 and exercised. After the exercise we were too hot to jump in the shower, and were trying to wait a little while after the exercise to eat breakfast. So I decided that it was a good time to spend with God.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was having a discussion with the awesome staff at &lt;a href=&#34;http://renownchurch.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Renown Church&lt;/a&gt;
 about Abraham and how he was recognised as someone loved by God because of his incredible wealth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For many years now I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to go on a mission trip with my church, &lt;a href=&#34;http://highwayaog.co.za&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Highway Church&lt;/a&gt;
. A few years ago I had planned to go and started the process, but ultimately could not go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friends were scheduled to land at 06:35, but their flight was running about 20 minutes early. Not a problem though - my bus was due to arrive early and I was at the airport just a bit after 06:25.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little while ago God challenged me to start giving more money as an offering to Him. It started with one project&amp;rsquo;s wage, but God soon prompted me to give Him a whole lot more - basically everything that wasn&amp;rsquo;t my regular, base income was to go to God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Things at home are changing, and part of that change was moving a bunch of stuff out the house. Some of that stuff is alcohol, something I hate. It&amp;rsquo;s standing on the dining room table at the moment, and I ask why it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been thrown out yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, it&amp;rsquo;s a controversial title, but it got you reading, didn&amp;rsquo;t it? Anyway, this is an idea that I believe God kinda dropped into my heart the other day: Evangelism isn&amp;rsquo;t about getting everyone saved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve grown up in the church in many ways. Sure, I haven&amp;rsquo;t always been in church, but for most of my life I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to a traditional church setting. We&amp;rsquo;ve been going through two series at church, and both have been radically challenging my idea of church.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So why would I go and change my screen name from &lt;a href=&#34;http://leew4jc.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;leew4jc&lt;/a&gt;
 to UniekLee? Well, there are a number of reasons, so I thought I would explain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>You can ready about why I chose to do this in my blog post, Why UniekLee? One of the things that comes with a rebranding is a new logo. I know what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking - you&amp;rsquo;re a human being, why do you need a logo? Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t. I have no use for one at all. But I want one: it&amp;rsquo;s cool, it&amp;rsquo;s fun, it&amp;rsquo;s something that I enjoy.Now when it comes to designing a logo, I have very strong beliefs about what a logo should be.</description>
