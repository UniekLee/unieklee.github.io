      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a great prayer meeting at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://renownchurch.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Renown Church&lt;/a&gt;
, &lt;a href=&#34;http://renownchurch.com/campuses/edenvale/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Edenvale Campus&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mattlewis516&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;
 preached an incredibly challenging and inspiring message entitled &lt;a href=&#34;http://highwayaog.co.za/resources/messages/?sermon_id=287&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;My Plus One is Different From Me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/a&gt;
