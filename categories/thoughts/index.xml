 preached an incredibly challenging and inspiring message entitled &lt;a href=&#34;http://highwayaog.co.za/resources/messages/?sermon_id=287&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;My Plus One is Different From Me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/a&gt;
 If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard it, I&amp;rsquo;d suggest that you give it a listen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life is unfair. We all know that. And I&amp;rsquo;ve actually had enough of being put down by the unfairness that is inherent of life!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little while ago God challenged me to start giving more money as an offering to Him. It started with one project&amp;rsquo;s wage, but God soon prompted me to give Him a whole lot more - basically everything that wasn&amp;rsquo;t my regular, base income was to go to God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-story&#34;&gt;The Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things at home are changing, and part of that change was moving a bunch of stuff out the house. Some of that stuff is alcohol, something I hate. It&amp;rsquo;s standing on the dining room table at the moment, and I ask why it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been thrown out yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
