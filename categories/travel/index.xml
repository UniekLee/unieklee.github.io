      <description>&lt;p&gt;This afternoon we stopped in at Corfe Castle. It&amp;rsquo;s an old castle that now lies in ruin, but the adjacent Corfe town is absolutely beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The alliterative titles are back! Woo hoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning saw us taking a trip out the the Durdle Door. It&amp;rsquo;s a natural limestone archway right on the coast in the middle of a pair of beautiful beaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once again I&amp;rsquo;m off to London! A few hours ago I climbed aboard my Qatar flight toward London with the primary purpose of attending my friend&amp;rsquo;s (Taryn&amp;rsquo;s) wedding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For many years now I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to go on a mission trip with my church, &lt;a href=&#34;http://highwayaog.co.za&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Highway Church&lt;/a&gt;
. A few years ago I had planned to go and started the process, but ultimately could not go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friends were scheduled to land at 06:35, but their flight was running about 20 minutes early. Not a problem though - my bus was due to arrive early and I was at the airport just a bit after 06:25.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
