# Transfer in Doha


We've arrived safely in Doha and now sit and wait for our next flight. I really enjoyed the first flight - the Boeing 787 is a beautiful aircraft and a pleasant flight.<!--more--> Our next flight is aboard the Airbus A380, an aircraft I've wanted to fly aboard for many years now.





The geek in me is really happy right now!





The transfer was really easy - we basically had to walk in a straight line.





At the Doha airport they seem to check you in to your flight before you enter the waiting area rather than as you're about the board the plane, which seems like a more efficient way of doing things.





We've also been organised into zones for more efficient boarding - a much better idea!





So far, so good! And the fact that I'm heading on holiday still hasn't quite set in!
