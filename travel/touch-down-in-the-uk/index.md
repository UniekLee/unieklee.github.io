# Touch down in the UK!


And we have arrived! Gaby and I are safe and sound in the UK. We arrived a few minutes early, made our way through passport control, baggage claim and customs without issue.<!--more-->

She met up with her cousin and has headed off to start her stay in the UK. It's a pretty big adventure for her!

I, on the other hand, sit at the airport writing this blog post and waiting for my bus to Bournemouth to meet up with Dean and Carmen. I'm looking forward to seeing them and spending some time with them.

I've managed to find myself a sim card and get my phone up and running, connect to the wifi and let everyone know I'm here safely and will be arriving soon, and write a blog post! A pretty good start to my holiday!

Let's see what happens!
